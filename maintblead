This distribution requires at least Perl $REQUIRED to be installed.  Since this
is an older distribution, with a history spanning almost a decade, it is also
available inside this distribution as a previous incarnation, which is actively
maintained as well.

You can install that version of this distribution by running this $0
with the additional "maint" parameter, like so:

 $^X $0 maint

Or you can provide an automatic selection behavior, which would automatically
select and install the right version of this distribution for the version of
Perl provided, by setting the AUTO_SELECT_MAINT_OR_BLEAD environment variable
to a true value.  On Unix-like systems like so:

 AUTO_SELECT_MAINT_OR_BLEAD=1 $^X $0

Thank you for your attention.

SORRY
