Sub-class of Thread::Queue that creates a special queue and a monitoring
thread that monitors the values that are sent to the queue.  Can be used
for simple logging or warning for specific events or whatever you want
to monitor that is able to send information to the monitored queue.

only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with any
version of Perl before 5.8.0-RC3 or without threads enabled.
