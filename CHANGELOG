0.03	17 July 2002
	My my, third version on the same day!

	Added class method "self" for use within the "pre" or "monitor"
	routine the Thread::Queue::Monitored object they're working for.

	Changed the input parameters of "new" to be more like those of
	Thread::Pool->new.  This is incompatible with the way it was
	before.  Fortunately there won't be that many people hurt by
	it.  Adapted the test-suite accordingly.

0.02	17 July 2002
	Added support for Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored by making the
	monitoring routine dependent on the class for which it is being
	blessed.

	Fixed some documentation nits.

0.01	17 July 2002
	First version of Thread::Queue::Monitored.
