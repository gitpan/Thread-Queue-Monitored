0.08	28 December 2003
	Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

0.07	13 August 2003
	Cleaned up Makefile.PL and updated copyright info.  Made sure the
	test-suite runs without warnings.

	Removed use of "our" and ":unique" from the source, as with all my
	other thread modules.

0.06	24 July 2002
	Made the dequeue_xxx methods die centrally.

	Made $VERSION and @ISA have the : unique attribute to save memory.

	23 July 2002
	Fixed problem with warnings if an undefined exit value was used
	(the default).

0.05	21 July 2002
	Added "can_ok" test to test-suite.

	Renamed dummy "dequeue_nb" to "dequeue_dontwait" to be more in line
	with Thread::Pool.  Added synonym "dequeue_nb" for compatibility.

0.04	18 July 2002
	Added support for "post" routine, so that a routine will be executed
	when monitoring stops.  Results of the "post" routine are available
	with the "join" method on the thread object.

0.03	17 July 2002
	My my, third version on the same day!

	Added class method "self" for use within the "pre" or "monitor"
	routine the Thread::Queue::Monitored object they're working for.

	Changed the input parameters of "new" to be more like those of
	Thread::Pool->new.  This is incompatible with the way it was
	before.  Fortunately there won't be that many people hurt by
	it.  Adapted the test-suite accordingly.

0.02	17 July 2002
	Added support for Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored by making the
	monitoring routine dependent on the class for which it is being
	blessed.

	Fixed some documentation nits.

0.01	17 July 2002
	First version of Thread::Queue::Monitored.
